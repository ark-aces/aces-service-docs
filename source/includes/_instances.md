# Instances

Instances run on any web server and can be made private or public. Multiple instances may
also run on a single web server using different HTTP ports. 

We don't make any guarantees on how instances are managed, so consumers will need to host
their own instances, subscribe to only trusted providers, or subscribe to multiple instances to
ensure they can access services in the case a provider goes down.

The upcoming ACES Service Marketplace will add a layer of trust and stability to Services
by verifying service providers and enabling fallbacks in case a provider goes down.
