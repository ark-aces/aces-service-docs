# Contract Interfaces

The ACES Service API defines a highly abstract blueprint for services that can
perform many different types of functions across many different blockchains. 
As such, ACES contracts are able to accept a flexible range of input values
and return an equally flexible range of result data for contract executions.

To simplify integration of services into a common Marketplace, the ACES Service
API defines several Contract Interfaces to control presentational aspects 
of different types of contracts.

These interfaces tell consumers the semantic meaning of certain sets of contract 
request and response parameters, so they can be rendered or controlled differently
in the Marketplace or other UI applications.

We expect to add more Contract Interfaces as more blockchains are integrated
and different types of contracts are defined. Some examples may include interfaces
such as `fileUpload`, `multiFileUpload`, `expirable`, etc...
