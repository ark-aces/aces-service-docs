# ACES Service API Docs

The ACES Service API Specification defines the API interface for ACES Services to
be listed on the Service Marketplace. 
[SDKs](https://github.com/ark-aces/aces-service-api#sdks)
are available in Java, Go, PHP, JavaScript, Python, and C#.

The Service API provides a common way for to define blockchain interoperability services
and exposes them over a simple REST-ful API. The API allows service consumers to 
create Service contracts, pay for contracts, get results of contract executions.
